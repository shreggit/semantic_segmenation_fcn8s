Hi all,

Here are some links that can help you get started on SCC with a GPU. We assume you are familiar with working on Linux/Unix terminals to a certain degree, so we will skip details such as how to create a directory, ssh, etc. If you have never used these things before, this is the best time to make friends with people who have experience with this in the class :)

1. ssh to a guest node in SCC (e.g. ssh {yourbuname}@scc1.bu.edu), then request and login to a node with the acquired GPU.

Especially, look at the example in "Interactive Batch".

https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/software-and-programming/programming/multiprocessor/gpu-computing/#RUNNINGONGPUS

After logging in to the node with a GPU, try "nvidia-smi" and see if there is any GPU information returned. If not, that means you are still in a guest node and you need to request for a GPU before moving on.

2. Create a conda virtual environment for your project/homework:

Remember, you should load 'miniconda' module instead of 'conda' (note, you should LOAD the miniconda module provided by SCC instead of trying to install the anaconda yourself!!!).

https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/software-and-programming/common-languages/python/anaconda/

after loading the module, you should be able to call 'conda' in the terminal. Create a conda virtual environment like you did before in your local machine.

Install any libraries/packages you need for your project/homework. If you have no clue what you need to install, take a look at the "import" lines in your code and Google how to install them in your created virtual environment.

3. Since most of our works are based on Jupyter Notebook, to start coding:

Login to SCC ondemand:

https://scc-ondemand1.bu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard

Look at the top: Interactive Apps -> Jupyter Notebook

Read the following link to know what to fill in to create a Jupyter Notebook server you need for coding. (Note: NEVER try this step until you finished steps 1 & 2, otherwise things will not work)

https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/software-and-programming/common-languages/python/jupyter/

The place to save your code and files should be "/projectnb/${cs585_scc_project_name}/{yourbuusername}" {yourbuuername} should be your bu username (mkdir one if you don't have one). Don't put your code directly in the root directory ".../${cs585_scc_project_name}/", or they will be removed whenever we see them.

To check whether the server is created with your conda virtual environment, try importing libraries you installed in step 2 in the Jupyter notebook interface.  For example, if you installed pytorch at step 2, "import torch" should work in your Jupyter Notebook interface now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So to summarize how to start with SCC for our homework/project, you need to:

1. request a computing node with a GPU 

2. create a virtual environment with miniconda and install everything you need for the homeworks/projects

3. set up a Jupyter Notebook server that is built on your created virtual environment.

 

If you have any questions regarding the process above, you should contact the SCC team

help@scc.bu.edu

anytime during working hours.

Or you can talk to me during my office hours.
